    "In a world where we're losing hope\nAnd life has us on the ropes\nMisunderstandings\nHate running rampant\nEvery man out for his own",
    "It seems like we've lost our way\nAnd the distance grows every day\nThought that we had it\nCaught in the madness\nOh, ain't it tragic?",
    "But You said\nIf we turn from our wicked ways\nAnd humbled ourselves and pray\nAnd seek Your face\nYou'd give us grace\nOh come, have Your way, Lord",
    "Here we are\nAbandoned hearts\nOn bended knees with outstretched arms\nGod, hear us from Heaven\nSend us Your presence\nWe need You, Lord\nWe need You, Lord",
    "Summer and spring may pass\nBut winter and fall won't last\nI can trust the Creator's\nPerfect in nature\nBetter is coming, I know",
    "And just like the rising sun\nOur faith is rising up\nYou're the God of Your promise\nAnd what You have started\nYou're faithful to finish",
